PCB USB LED Project
===================

Description
-----------
This project demonstrates the design of a simple PCB that can be plugged directly into a USB port.
When connected, the PCB powers up and lights the onboard LED â€” a small but effective practice for learning PCB design workflows and USB edge connector dimensions.

The design was made with KiCad, covering the complete process:
- Creating and customizing footprints
- Drawing schematic symbols
- Developing schematic diagrams
- Practicing PCB layout design
- Exploring multi-PCB panelization

Key Insight
-----------
To use a PCB as a USB connector, the total thickness must be around 2.2 mm to ensure proper contact.

Tools & Technologies
--------------------
- KiCad (schematic & PCB layout)
- PCB fabrication basics
- Electronics prototyping

Learning Outcomes
-----------------
- Hands-on experience with PCB design workflow
- Understanding footprint and symbol creation in KiCad
- Practical knowledge of panelization and USB PCB thickness requirements
